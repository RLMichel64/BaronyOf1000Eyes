#### Paon d’Argent- [Argent Peacock] (chivalrous behavior off the field)

Chivalry is the proper pursuit of all good gentles. Its several treasured virtues--generosity,
courtesy, courage, and humility--are often recognized on the field of battle, but it is off the field
of combat and within our daily lives that these virtues have their greatest effect. There are those
among us whose steadfast chivalry permeates all that they do. To recognize those individuals as
an example to us all their excellencies, Lyonel and Aquilanne, did establish the Order of the
Argent Peacock, that each and all may know by these presents that `name` by virtue of
gallantry, courtesy, and generosity is declared a companion of the Order of the Paon d’Argent.
In recognition of chivalrous behavior, may all accord this (gentle/lady) such rights, privileges,
and responsibilities as are due a member of this virtuous order. Done this **_ day of _**, Anno
