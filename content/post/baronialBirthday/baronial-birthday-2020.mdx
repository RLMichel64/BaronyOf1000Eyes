## Zoom Links

### Main Room

All attendees are encouraged to “hang out” in this room throughout the day.  A host will be available throughout the day, so if you and a group of friends wishes to have a more private discussion simply text the host and ask them to provide you a separate room (request your own table).  We are analogizing this to sitting at your own table in the main room and having conversation with those at your table.

### A&S Classrooms

Welcome to the gathering place for all artisans.  Please feel free to enter this room to converse with others on all things A&S.  Scheduled classes will be placed in a separate room by the room host at the listed time.  Those who wish to continue their own conversation (or informal instructional sessions) may remain in the room while the scheduled 
  class is occurring without interfering with each other.  If people desire a more quiet conversation please reach out to the room host who can put you in a separate room with the appropriate people (requesting your own table).
