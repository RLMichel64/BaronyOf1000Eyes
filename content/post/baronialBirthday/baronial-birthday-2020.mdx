## Zoom Links Coming Shortly

#### Welcome one and all to the Baronial Birthday event sponsored by the Barony of One Thousand Eyes!

We hope you will enjoy the day hanging out with each other and helping to make this required virtual reality a little better less isolated.

All rooms will open at 11:00am and will remain open throughout the event. Upon arriving at the event, please take a moment to sign in!

Then click on the link to the Main Room area. People will be able to mingle and talk freely until Court begins, at which time all participants will be muted in order to reduce background noise.

If you have any questions or need any assistance, please feel free to message the autocorrect, THL Crestina da Brescia
